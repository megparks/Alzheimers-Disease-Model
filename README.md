# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Model
A differential equation model of neuron death in Alzheimer's disease patients developed in R
This repository contains the markdown code to run the model, the image files required to run the markdown file and a powerpoint presentation with more background on the work. The markdown file contains only a bare minimum of information to help in understanding the code. For more detailed information see the presentation. To compile the markdown file you will need the code and image files in the same directory. The code was run under R studio version Version 1.2.5042 with R version 4.0.0 (2020-04-24)
